SearchSample
============

Just a quick Sample app showing how the Search Interface works.

TODO
====

Make the new "OK, Google"  search functionality work. I've tried adding the `com.google.android.gms.actions.SEARCH_ACTION` intent filter. Howver, it does not seem to respond to it. Is it API levels?
